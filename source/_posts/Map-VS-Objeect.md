# Maps vs. Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript provides two primary data structures for storing key-value pairs: Maps and Objects. While they may seem similar at first, they have distinct differences and use cases.

## Objects

Objects in JavaScript are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store and manipulate data using key-value pairs. The keys are typically strings or symbols, and the values can be of any data type, including other objects or functions.


const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  job: 'Developer',
};


### Key features:
1. Key Type: Object keys are usually strings or symbols, making them less versatile than Map keys.
2. Property Order: Object properties are not guaranteed to maintain a specific order. The order of properties is implementation-dependent and may not match the insertion order.
3. Iterating: To iterate over the properties of an object, you often need to use for...in loops or the Object.keys(), Object.values(), or Object.entries() methods.


## Maps

Maps, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a more powerful and versatile way to manage key-value pairs in JavaScript. Maps can use any data type as keys, making them more flexible.


const userMap = new Map();
userMap.set('name', 'Alice');
userMap.set('age', 25);


1. Key Type: Map keys can be of any data type, including objects, functions, and primitive values.
2. Property Order: Maps guarantee the order of key-value pairs based on the insertion order. This order is maintained when iterating over the map.
3. Iterating: Maps provide built-in methods like forEach, keys(), values(), and entries() for easy iteration over key-value pairs.
4. Functions: get, set, delete, clear

## Choosing Between Maps and Objects
When deciding between using Maps or Objects in your JavaScript code, consider the following:
    1. Use Objects when you have a simple structure and you mainly need to store string keys and values.
    2. Use Maps when you need flexibility in key types, order preservation, and built-in iteration methods.
